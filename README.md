## Development Methodology:
* Each contributor pushes code in their own branch (mostly named after them).
* A pull request is created to merge the code to `dev-{name}` branch which is our development branch.
* After each sprint, the final code is merged with `main` branch which is our final working product.
* A checkpoint branch is also created after each sprint for the purpose of tracking changes between two sprints.
